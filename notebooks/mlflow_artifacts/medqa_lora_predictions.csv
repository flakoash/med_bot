What is (are) Hypoglycemia ?,"Hypoglycemia means low blood glucose, or blood sugar. Your body needs glucose to have enough energy. After you eat, your blood absorbs glucose. If you eat more sugar than your body needs, your muscles, and liver store the extra. When your blood sugar begins to fall, a hormone tells your liver to release glucose.    In most people, this raises blood sugar. If it doesn't, you have hypoglycemia, and your blood sugar can be dangerously low. Signs include        - Hunger    - Shakiness    - Dizziness    - Confusion    - Difficulty speaking    - Feeling anxious or weak       In people with diabetes, hypoglycemia is often a side effect of diabetes medicines. Eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. If it happens often, your health care provider may need to change your treatment plan.    You can also have low blood sugar without having diabetes. Causes include certain medicines or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, and tumors. Laboratory tests can help find the cause. The kind of treatment depends on why you have low blood sugar.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",180,True,True,"Hypoglycemia is abnormally low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia is a serious health problem that can happen to anyone. You have a higher risk of developing it if you have diabetes and take too much insulin or other diabetes medicines. Hypoglycemia can happen when your body doesn't have enough glucose (sugar) in your blood. Glucose is important for your body to work properly. It is the main source of energy for your body. If your blood glucose drops below a certain level, your body starts to break down stored fat for energy. This process is called ketosis. Ketosis can cause your body to produce ketones. Ketones are substances that are produced when your body breaks down fat for energy. You can have ketones in your urine, breath, or blood. You can have ketones in your urine, breath, or blood.

What are the symptoms of Dysautonomia like disorder ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Dysautonomia like disorder? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Dysautonomia like disorder. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Dysautonomia - Intellectual disability - Peripheral neuropathy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",237,True,True,The signs and symptoms of Dysautonomia like disorder include - Blood pressure problems - Confusion and disorientation - Difficulty swallowing - Dizziness - Fatigue - Headache - Nausea and vomiting - Rapid heart rate - Sudden loss of muscle control - Sweating - Tremors
What is (are) Tumors and Pregnancy ?,"Tumors during pregnancy are rare, but they can happen. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are.

What are the treatments for Psoriasis ?,"The goals of psoriasis treatment are to change the course of the disease by interfering with the increased production of skin cells, and to remove scales and smooth rough skin.",30,True,True,"Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes the rapid growth of skin cells.

In autoimmune conditions, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. In psoriasis, the immune system attacks healthy skin cells. The immune system mistakenly sends signals that speed up the growth of skin cells. Skin cells normally grow deep in the skin and then slowly move up to the surface. Normally, it takes about a month for new skin cells to move up to the surface. Psoriasis causes skin cells to grow too quickly. The cells build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches. The process of skin cells growing too quickly is called hyperproliferation. It is not known what triggers the immune system to send signals that cause skin cells to grow too quickly. Psoriasis can be triggered by a number of factors.
