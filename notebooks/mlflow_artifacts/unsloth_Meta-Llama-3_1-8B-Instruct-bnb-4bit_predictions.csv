What causes Dry Eye ?,"Most people with dry eye will not have serious problems, but severe dry eye may lead to inflammation, ulcers, or scars on the cornea, and some loss of vision. Permanent loss of vision from dry eye is uncommon.",38,True,True,"Dry eye, also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a common condition characterized by a lack of sufficient lubrication and moisture on the surface of the eye. There are several causes of dry eye, including:

1. **Aging**: As people age, the glands that produce tears in the eyes (meibomian glands) tend to decrease in function, leading to a decrease in tear quality and quantity.
2. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to wind, dry air, cold weather, and air conditioning can dry out the eyes.
3. **Medications**: Certain medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants, and blood pressure medications, can reduce tear production.
4. **Systemic diseases**: Certain conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and Sj√∂gren's syndrome, can cause dry eye.
5. **Contact lens wear**: Wearing contact lenses can reduce tear production and cause dry eye.
6. **Meibomian gland dysfunction**: Blockages or inflammation of the meibomian glands can lead to dry eye.
7. **Blepharitis**: Inflammation of the eyelids can cause dry eye.
8. **Computer use**: Prolonged computer use can cause dry eye due to decreased blink rate.
9. **Nutritional deficiencies**: Deficiencies in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and other nutrients can contribute to dry eye.
10. **Genetics**: Some people may be more prone to dry eye due to genetic factors.
11. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations during menopause or pregnancy can cause dry eye.
12. **Other medical conditions**: Certain conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid disease, and Parkinson's disease, can increase the risk of dry eye.

It's worth noting that dry eye is often a complex condition, and multiple factors can contribute to its development."
What is (are) Canker Sores ?,"Canker sores are small, round sores in your mouth. They can be on the inside of your cheek, under your tongue, or in the back of your throat. They usually have a red edge and a gray center. They can be quite painful. They are not the same as cold sores, which are caused by herpes simplex.    Canker sores aren't contagious. They may happen if you have a viral infection. They may also be triggered by stress, food allergies, lack of vitamins and minerals, hormonal changes or menstrual periods. In some cases the cause is unknown.    In most cases, the sores go away by themselves. Some ointments, creams or rinses may help with the pain. Avoiding hot, spicy food while you have a canker sore also helps.",127,True,True,"Canker sores, also known as aphthous ulcers, are small, shallow lesions that develop on the inside of the cheeks, lips, gums, or the base of the tongue. They are usually painful and can make eating, drinking, and speaking uncomfortable.

Canker sores are:

1. **Small**: Typically measuring 1-3 millimeters in diameter.
2. **Shallow**: The ulcers are not deeply embedded in the mucosa.
3. **Painful**: Canker sores can be quite painful, especially when they are located on the tongue or the inside of the mouth.
4. **Temporary**: Canker sores usually heal within 1-3 weeks without leaving any scars.

The exact cause of canker sores is still unknown, but several factors can contribute to their development:

1. **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can trigger canker sores.
2. **Food sensitivities**: Some people may experience canker sores due to food sensitivities or allergies.
3. **Vitamin deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins B12 or iron may contribute to the development of canker sores.
4. **Oral hygiene**: Poor oral hygiene or using a sharp toothbrush can irritate the mucosa and lead to canker sores.
5. **Genetics**: Canker sores may run in families.
6. **Medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can increase the risk of developing canker sores.

Treatment for canker sores typically involves:

1. **Topical creams**: Over-the-counter creams or gels containing lidocaine, benzocaine, or hydrogen peroxide can help numb the pain and speed up the healing process.
2. **Antibacterial mouthwashes**: Rinsing with an antibacterial mouthwash can help prevent infections.
3. **Dietary changes**: Avoiding spicy, acidic, or sharp foods and drinks can help reduce discomfort.
4. **Rest**: Getting plenty of rest and managing stress can help alleviate symptoms.

If you experience recurring or severe canker sores, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions."
What is (are) Animal Bites ?,"Wild animals usually avoid people. They might attack, however, if they feel threatened, are sick, or are protecting their young or territory. Attacks by pets are more common. Animal bites rarely are life-threatening, but if they become infected, you can develop serious medical problems.     To prevent animal bites and complications from bites       -  Never pet, handle, or feed unknown animals     -  Leave snakes alone    -  Watch your children closely around animals    -  Vaccinate your cats, ferrets, and dogs against rabies    -  Spay or neuter your dog to make it less aggressive    -  Get a tetanus booster if you have not had one recently    -  Wear boots and long pants when you are in areas with venomous snakes       If an animal bites you, clean the wound with soap and water as soon as possible. Get medical attention if necessary.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",144,True,True,"Animal bites are injuries caused by the teeth of animals, typically mammals, birds, or reptiles. These bites can result in various types of injuries, ranging from minor scratches to severe lacerations and puncture wounds.

Some common types of animal bites include:

1. **Dog bites**: These are the most common type of animal bite and can be serious, especially if the dog is large or has a history of aggression.
2. **Cat bites**: Cat bites are often more serious than they appear, as the bacteria in cat saliva can cause infection and abscesses.
3. **Snake bites**: While not typically considered a ""bite,"" snake bites involve the injection of venom into the skin, which can cause systemic symptoms and even death.
4. **Horse bites**: Horse bites can be severe, especially if the horse is kicked or bites with its front teeth.
5. **Other animal bites**: Bites from other animals, such as bears, raccoons, and rodents, can also be serious and require medical attention.

Animal bites can be classified into different types based on the severity of the injury:

1. **Minor bites**: These are superficial bites that do not penetrate deep into the skin.
2. **Deep puncture wounds**: These are bites that penetrate deep into the skin and can cause significant tissue damage.
3. **Compound fractures**: These are bites that cause fractures of the bone.
4. **Infections**: Bites can become infected, especially if the animal's saliva contains bacteria.

It is essential to seek medical attention immediately if you have been bitten by an animal, as prompt treatment can prevent serious complications and promote healing."
What is (are) Diphtheria ?,"Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection. You can catch it from a person who has the infection and coughs or sneezes. You can also get infected by coming in contact with an object, such as a toy, that has bacteria on it.    Diphtheria usually affects the nose and throat. Symptoms include       - Sore throat    - Swollen glands in the neck    - Fever    - Weakness       Your doctor will diagnose it based on your signs and symptoms and a lab test. Getting treatment for diphtheria quickly is important. If your doctor suspects that you have it, you'll start treatment before the lab tests come back. Treatment is with antibiotics.    The diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine can prevent diphtheria, but its protection does not last forever. Children need another dose, or booster, at about age 12. Then, as adults, they should get a booster every 10 years. Diphtheria is very rare in the United States because of the vaccine.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",162,True,True,"Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* that affects the mucous membranes of the throat and nose. It can also affect the skin and other parts of the body. The infection can lead to the formation of a thick, grayish membrane in the throat, which can cause difficulty in swallowing and breathing.

Diphtheria is characterized by the following symptoms:

1. **Respiratory symptoms**: Coughing, difficulty breathing, and a feeling of choking due to the formation of a membrane in the throat.
2. **Neurological symptoms**: Weakness or paralysis of the face, arms, or legs, which can be caused by the toxin produced by the bacteria.
3. **Cardiovascular symptoms**: Abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, and cardiac arrest, which can be caused by the toxin.
4. **General symptoms**: Fever, headache, sore throat, and fatigue.

Diphtheria is usually spread through:

1. **Direct contact**: Touching or shaking hands with someone who has the infection.
2. **Indirect contact**: Touching surfaces or objects that have come into contact with the bacteria.
3. **Airborne transmission**: Inhaling droplets that contain the bacteria.

There are two types of diphtheria:

1. **Toxigenic diphtheria**: This is the most common type, caused by the toxin produced by the bacteria.
2. **Non-toxigenic diphtheria**: This type is caused by the bacteria alone, without the production of the toxin.

The treatment of diphtheria involves:

1. **Antibiotics**: To eliminate the bacteria from the body.
2. **Diphtheria antitoxin**: To neutralize the toxin and prevent further damage.
3. **Supportive care**: To manage symptoms and prevent complications.

Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent diphtheria. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine or the combined diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, hepatitis B (DTaP-Hib) vaccine are available. Booster shots are recommended to maintain immunity.

In summary, diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection that can cause respiratory, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms. It is usually spread through direct or indirect contact and can be prevented through vaccination."
What is (are) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections ?,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild, cold-like symptoms in adults and older healthy children. It can cause serious problems in young babies, including pneumonia and severe breathing problems. Premature babies and those with other health problems have the highest risk. A child with RSV may have a fever, stuffy nose, cough, and trouble breathing. Lab tests can tell if your child has the virus. There is no specific treatment. You should give your child fluids to prevent dehydration. If needed, you can also give a pain reliever (not aspirin) for fever and headache.    RSV easily spreads from person to person. You can get it from direct contact with someone who has it or by touching infected objects such as toys or surfaces such as countertops. Washing your hands often and not sharing eating and drinking utensils are simple ways to help prevent the spread of RSV infection. There is currently no vaccine for RSV.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",160,True,True,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections are a common and contagious viral illness that affects people of all ages, but it's most severe in young children and older adults. RSV is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets, such as those produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking.

5. **Antiviral medications**, such as ribavirin, for high-risk individuals

**RSV Infection in High-Risk Populations:**

In addition to young children and older adults, RSV infection can be severe in other high-risk populations, including:

1. **Premature babies**: RSV infection can be life-threatening in premature babies.
2. **Immunocompromised individuals**: People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy, are more susceptible to severe RSV infections.
3. **People with chronic health conditions**: Individuals with conditions like heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes may be more prone to severe RSV infections.

Overall, RSV infections are a significant public health concern, and understanding the risks and symptoms is crucial for effective prevention and management."
Who is at risk for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer? ?,"Smoking is the major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for lung cancer.    Risk factors for lung cancer include the following:            -  Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars, now or in the past. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer.      -  Being exposed to secondhand smoke.     - Being exposed to radiation from any of the following:                  -  Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.       -  Radon in the home or workplace.       -  Imaging tests such as CT scans.       - Atomic bomb radiation.                 -  Being exposed to asbestos, chromium, nickel, beryllium, arsenic, soot, or tar in the workplace.     -  Living where there is air pollution.     -  Having a family history of lung cancer.     -  Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).     -  Taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.     When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased.",247,True,True,"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a type of lung cancer that accounts for about 85% of all lung cancer cases. Several factors increase the risk of developing NSCLC:

1. **Smoking**: Smoking is the leading cause of NSCLC, responsible for about 80% of all cases. The risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking.
2. **Age**: The risk of NSCLC increases with age, with most cases occurring in people over 65 years old.
3. **Genetics**: Some people may be born with genetic mutations that increase their risk of developing NSCLC. For example, individuals with a family history of lung cancer or those with a history of asbestos exposure may be at higher risk.
4. **Asbestos exposure**: Exposure to asbestos, a mineral fiber found in some building materials, increases the risk of developing NSCLC.
5. **Radon exposure**: Radon, a naturally occurring gas, can accumulate in homes and buildings, increasing the risk of NSCLC.
6. **Previous radiation therapy**: People who have received radiation therapy to the chest, such as those treated for Hodgkin lymphoma, may be at higher risk of developing NSCLC.
7. **Family history**: A family history of lung cancer, particularly if it is diagnosed at a young age, may indicate a genetic predisposition to NSCLC.
8. **Occupational exposure**: Workers in industries that involve exposure to carcinogens, such as radon, asbestos, or diesel fuel, may be at higher risk of developing NSCLC.
9. **Air pollution**: Long-term exposure to air pollution, particularly particulate matter and ozone, may increase the risk of NSCLC.
10. **Lack of screening**: People who do not undergo regular lung cancer screening, such as low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans, may be at higher risk of developing NSCLC at an advanced stage.

It's essential to note that many people with no known risk factors develop NSCLC. If you have concerns about your risk, consult with your healthcare provider."
Who is at risk for Heart Attack? ?,"Certain factors increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease and having a heart attack. These risk factors include some things you cannot change. You are at greater risk if you -  are a man over age 45 or a woman over age 55.  -  have a family history of early heart disease -- heart disease in a father or brother before age 55 or in a mother or sister before age 65.   - have a personal history of angina or previous heart attack.   -  have had a heart procedure, such as angioplasty or heart bypass. are a man over age 45 or a woman over age 55. have a family history of early heart disease -- heart disease in a father or brother before age 55 or in a mother or sister before age 65. have a personal history of angina or previous heart attack. have had a heart procedure, such as angioplasty or heart bypass. Importantly, there are many risk factors for heart attack that you CAN change, including -  smoking  - being obese or overweight  - being physically inactive   -  having high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol or diabetes. smoking being obese or overweight being physically inactive having high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol or diabetes.",209,True,True,"Several groups of people are at higher risk for heart attack, including:

1. **Men over 45 years old and women over 55 years old**: The risk of heart attack increases with age, and men are more likely to have a heart attack than women before the age of 55.
2. **Family history**: If you have a family history of heart disease, particularly if a parent or sibling had a heart attack before the age of 55, you may be at higher risk.
3. **High blood pressure**: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels and increase the risk of heart attack.
4. **High cholesterol**: High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, can increase the risk of heart attack.
5. **Diabetes**: People with diabetes are at higher risk of heart attack due to the damage diabetes can cause to blood vessels and nerves.
6. **Smoking**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for heart attack, as it damages the blood vessels and increases blood pressure.
7. **Obesity**: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of heart attack, as excess weight can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
8. **Physical inactivity**: A sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of heart attack, as regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure and improve blood flow.
9. **History of heart disease**: If you have had a heart attack or stroke in the past, you are at higher risk of having another heart attack.
10. **Stress**: Chronic stress can increase the risk of heart attack by raising blood pressure and increasing the production of stress hormones like cortisol.
11. **Poor diet**: A diet high in saturated fats, trans fats, and sodium can increase the risk of heart attack by raising blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
12. **History of preeclampsia**: Women who have had preeclampsia during pregnancy are at higher risk of heart attack later in life.

If you identify with any of these risk factors, it's essential to talk to your doctor about ways to reduce your risk of heart attack, such as:

* Maintaining a healthy weight
* Following a balanced diet
* Engaging in regular physical activity
* Managing stress
* Quitting smoking
* Controlling high blood pressure and high cholesterol
* Getting regular check-ups and screenings

Early detection and treatment can help prevent or reduce the risk of heart attack."
What is (are) Small Intestine Disorders ?,"Your small intestine is the longest part of your digestive system - about twenty feet long! It connects your stomach to your large intestine (or colon) and folds many times to fit inside your abdomen. Your small intestine does most of the digesting of the foods you eat. It has three areas called the duodenum, the ileum, and the jejunum.    Problems with the small intestine can include:       - Bleeding    - Celiac disease    - Crohn's disease    - Infections    - Intestinal cancer    - Intestinal obstruction    - Irritable bowel syndrome    - Ulcers, such as peptic ulcer       Treatment of disorders of the small intestine depends on the cause.",104,True,True,"Small intestine disorders refer to conditions that affect the small intestine, a vital part of the digestive system. The small intestine is responsible for absorbing nutrients from food, and disorders can lead to malabsorption, nutrient deficiencies, and other complications. Here are some common small intestine disorders:

1. **Celiac Disease**: An autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to react to gluten, leading to inflammation and damage to the small intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss.
2. **Crohn's Disease**: A type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, including the small intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue.
3. **SIBO (Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth)**: A condition where bacteria overgrow in the small intestine, leading to symptoms like bloating, gas, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
4. **Short Bowel Syndrome**: A condition that occurs when a significant portion of the small intestine is removed or damaged, leading to malabsorption of nutrients.
5. **Whipple's Disease**: A rare bacterial infection that affects the small intestine, leading to malabsorption of nutrients and weight loss.
6. **Radiation Enteritis**: Damage to the small intestine caused by radiation therapy, leading to inflammation and malabsorption of nutrients.
7. **Small Intestine Diverticulosis**: A condition where small pouches form in the wall of the small intestine, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.
8. **Malabsorption Disorders**: Conditions that impair the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients, such as lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance, and pancreatic insufficiency.
9. **Intestinal Obstruction**: A blockage in the small intestine that can cause severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation.
10. **Small Intestine Cancer**: A rare type of cancer that affects the small intestine, often causing symptoms like abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue.

What are the symptoms of Kasznica Carlson Coppedge syndrome ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Kasznica Carlson Coppedge syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kasznica Carlson Coppedge syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the palate 90% Hearing abnormality 90% Myelomeningocele 90% Ventricular septal defect 50% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",241,True,True,"I couldn't find any information on ""Kasznica Carlson Coppedge syndrome"".

What is (are) High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy ?,"If you are pregnant, high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your unborn baby. You may have had high blood pressure before you got pregnant. Or you may get it once you are pregnant - a condition called gestational hypertension. Either one can cause low birth weight or premature delivery of the baby.    Controlling your blood pressure during pregnancy and getting regular prenatal care are important for the health of you and your baby. Treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy may include close monitoring of the baby, lifestyle changes, and certain medicines.    Some pregnant women with high blood pressure develop preeclampsia. It's a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can be life-threatening for both you and the unborn baby. There is no proven way to prevent it. Most women who have signs of preeclampsia are closely monitored to lessen or avoid complications. The only way to ""cure"" preeclampsia is to deliver the baby.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",169,True,True,"High blood pressure in pregnancy, also known as hypertension in pregnancy, refers to the condition where a woman experiences high blood pressure during pregnancy. There are several types of high blood pressure that can occur during pregnancy, including:

1. **Gestational Hypertension**: Also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension, this is the most common type of high blood pressure in pregnancy. It typically develops after 20 weeks of gestation and usually resolves on its own after delivery.
2. **Chronic Hypertension**: Women who have a history of high blood pressure before pregnancy may experience chronic hypertension during pregnancy. This type of high blood pressure is more likely to be severe and require medical attention.
3. **Preeclampsia**: This is a more severe form of high blood pressure that can occur during pregnancy. It is characterized by high blood pressure and damage to the kidneys and other organs. Preeclampsia can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby if left untreated.
4. **Eclampsia**: This is a severe complication of preeclampsia, characterized by seizures or coma.

Causes and risk factors:

* Previous history of hypertension
* Family history of hypertension
* Obesity
* Smoking
* Multiple gestations (twins, triplets, etc.)
* Age (women over 35 years)
* Previous history of preeclampsia

Symptoms:

* High blood pressure
* Headaches
* Vision changes
* Nausea and vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Protein in the urine

Complications:

* Preterm birth
* Low birth weight
* Placental abruption (separation of the placenta from the uterus)
* Fetal growth restriction (slow growth of the baby)
* Maternal and fetal mortality

Diagnosis and treatment:

* Regular prenatal check-ups to monitor blood pressure and fetal growth
* Ultrasound to monitor fetal growth and detect any potential complications
* Blood pressure monitoring to diagnose hypertension
* Medications to lower blood pressure and prevent complications
* In severe cases, hospitalization and delivery may be necessary.

It's essential for pregnant women to work closely with their healthcare provider to monitor and manage high blood pressure during pregnancy."
